Label Encoder is for encoding the catergorical data/columns having more that one value like(Country-Germany, France and Spain) into values 0, 1, 2. Here , the value 0, 1, 2 does not have any preference over each other. They just simply represent categories in mathematical form.

OneHotEncoder is used to create dummy variables for the categorical columns which have been just converted/encoded by LabelEncoder.
